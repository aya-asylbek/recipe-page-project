    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by preparing the ingredients for the skewers. Cut the chicken into 1” – 1½” pieces. Then, cube the peppers and onions into pieces similar in size to the chicken.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, mix together the salt, pepper, and paprika.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, combine mayonnaise, oil, hot sauce, minced garlic cloves, and honey.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine chopped bell peppers, onion, mushrooms, and cubed chicken. Pour over the wet marinade ingredients and mix to coat everything evenly. Then, sprinkle over the dry seasonings and toss again. Cover with foil, and marinade in the fridge for 30 minutes to 4 hours, or overnight.</li>
        <li>Once the chicken has marinaded, thread the chicken and vegetables onto skewers, alternating to have veggie pieces in between chicken pieces. Expert tip: If using wooden skewers, be sure to soak them in water for at least 30 minutes to prevent them from burning over the grill.</li>
        <li>Grill the skewers over medium heat for 12-15 minutes until the chicken is cooked on all sides.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy, friends!</li>
